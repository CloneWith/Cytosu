# Status
Working on progress, not on my top priority so probably will have slow development progress but will try to give update every 2 weeks. I'm aiming to match Cytus gameplay as close as possible!
And also I probably need contributors who can help me, shoot me DMs if you interested ðŸ˜‰

# Releases
We don't provide any releases currently since it still in state where it is not really robust enough to deliver to end user. But in-case you wondering how the gameplay or you want demo, you can [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m--VLS8FCfQ)!

# Contribution
Want to help? I'm very open to contributors so just do it or contact me if you have any question (Discord: Ganen#3204)
